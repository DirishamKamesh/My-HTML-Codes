🐱 Cat Photo App – HTML Project

Welcome to my first HTML project, created as part of my learning journey in the FreeCodeCamp Web Development Certification! This simple Cat Photo App showcases the core structure of a webpage using clean, semantic HTML. It helped me understand how to combine different elements to build an accessible and well-organized layout.

🌟 Project Overview

The Cat Photo App is a beginner-friendly webpage that displays cute cat photos along with text content, links, and structured sections. This project focuses on the foundational building blocks of web development, including:

Using headings and paragraphs

Adding images

Creating links

Structuring a page with semantic HTML tags

Writing clean, readable code

It’s simple, but it marks an important step in my front-end development journey.

✨ Features
