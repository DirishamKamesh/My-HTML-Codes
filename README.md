 HTML Projects

Welcome to my first HTML project, created as part of my learning journey in the FreeCodeCamp Web Development Certification! This simple Cat Photo App showcases the core structure of a webpage using clean, semantic HTML. It helped me understand how to combine different elements to build an accessible and well-organized layout.

🌟 Project Overview

Structuring a page with semantic HTML tags

Writing clean, readable code

It’s simple, but it marks an important step in my front-end development journey.
