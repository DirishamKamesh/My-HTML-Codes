# CatPhotoApp
I created a simple Cat Photo App using basic HTML elements like headings, images, lists, and semantic tags. 🐱✨ It helped me learn webpage structure and write cleaner, more accessible code.  Proud to share this as part of my FreeCodeCamp Web Dev Certification! 🎓💻 More projects coming soon! 🚀🔥
